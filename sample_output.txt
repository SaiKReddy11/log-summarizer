Security Report:
Here are the security-critical events summarized in easy-to-understand bullet points, along with immediate action recommendations:

• **Multiple failed password attempts for admin**: Someone is trying to log in as "admin" from IP address 192.168.1.100 (3 times between 8:00 and 8:02 AM). **Immediately lock out the account or change the password**.

• **Failed authentication for service nginx**: There was an unauthorized attempt to access your Nginx service (twice, at 8:03 and 8:06 AM). **Review your Nginx configuration and ensure no suspicious changes have been made**.

Remember to take immediate action to secure your system and network:

1. Lock out or change the "admin" account password.
2. Review Nginx configuration and log files for suspicious changes.
3. Investigate the unknown SSH login attempt and block the IP if necessary.
